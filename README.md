# Abstract games

A mini-project for Grinnell's CSC-207.

Authors:

* Lily Blanchard
* Tiffany Yan
* Natalie Nardone
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (Starter code)

Instructions:

To start, provide a width and height for the game board, with a minimum of 6.
If a number smaller than 6 is provided, that dimension will default to 6.
Each turn, select a piece, by entering its row and column, and a direction 
to move it. The goal is to make sets of 3 in a row of matching pieces. 
These will be removed and all pieces will fall to the bottom of the board. 
Continue making sets until there are no more possible moves that would make 
a set. Your score is the amount of pieces you removed from the board.

Acknowledgements:
Lily has provided the code for her implementation Matrix.java and MatrixVO.java & she has permitted of us using the code.
