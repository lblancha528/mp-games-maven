# Abstract games

A mini-project for Grinnell's CSC-207.

Authors:

* Lily Blanchard
* Tiffany Yan
* Natalie Nardone
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (Starter code)

Instructions:

To start, provide a width and height for the game board, with a minimum of 4.
Each turn, select a piece and a direction to move it. The goal is to make sets
of 3 in a row of matching pieces. These will be removed and all pieces will fall
to the bottom of the board. Continue making sets until there are no more possible
moves that would make a set. Your score is the amount of pieces you removed from
the board.
